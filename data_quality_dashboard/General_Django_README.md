# Django Application

This is a basic Django application. The following steps will guide you through setting up and running the application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Virtualenv** (optional, but recommended for isolating project dependencies)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
# OR
env\Scriptsctivate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can install Django manually:

```bash
pip install django
```

### 4. Apply Migrations

Django uses migrations to set up the database. Run the following command to apply the initial migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password for the superuser.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Accessing the Django Admin

Once the server is running, you can access the Django Admin at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.
